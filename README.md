IndieLibEditor
==============

Level Editor compatible with IndieLib library for the Symptogen game by H. Zaversnik, C. Champetier, E. Prana, T. Guigon,
J. TA, B. Laby and C. Lejeune

**For now, it's still under develop, so no executable ready**

How to run it
-------------
The Level Editor is made with the __Qt5 library__. So you need to have it already installed on your computer. __QtCreator__
is the best choice as IDE, as it can compile easily Qt with QMake.

Once your development environement is set up, just clone the repos and open the .pro in QCreator.
